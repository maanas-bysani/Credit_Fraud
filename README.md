# Credit_Fraud

Analysed 250,000+ transactions and 30+ features to train an ML model that detects, with a xx accuracy, whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not.

Made use of techniques and metrics suitable and relevant for handling imbalanced datasets such as cross-validation, confusion matrices and undersampling. 

Optimised code to effectively and quickly clean, process, and perform EDA even if handling a much larger dataset.
